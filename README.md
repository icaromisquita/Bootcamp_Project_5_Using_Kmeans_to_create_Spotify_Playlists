⚙ WBS Project 5 Unsupervised Machine Learning Clustering Songs

🔹 Using K-means clustering algorithm, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to create playlists on Spotify.


🔸 Project Intro/Objective

The purpose of this project is to use K-means clustering algorithm to cluster similar songs, thus creating playlists in an automated way.
Data had to be requested, structured, and visualized. First a database is built in mySQL Workbench based on the data.
Then the scripts are transferred to the cloud (Amazon Web Services) and scheduled to be executed every 24 hours. Iteratively, an SQL database of weather and flight-information is built in the cloud. </br>
